# Vehicles-API
## Introductions
Vehicles API is a backend system for a car website, and it's a REST-based API that communicates with a location and pricing service using Spring Boot, along with converting the existing Pricing Service API to a microservice registered on a Eureka server.
### Vehicles API
A REST API to maintain vehicle data and to provide a complete view of vehicle details including price and address.
### Pricing Service
The Pricing Service is a REST WebService that simulates a backend that would store and retrieve the price of a vehicle given a vehicle id as input. In this project, you will convert it to a microservice.
### Boogle Maps
This is a Mock that simulates a Maps WebService where, given a latitude longitude, will return a random address.
